# wp-docker-starter
Dockerized starting point for Wordpress development including most popular
starter themes. It's created to be used as a laboratory complete with all the
features and server configurations that you'd need in order to be getting
started with your Wordpress development as fast as possible.

## Features
* PHP7.0, NGINX and MariaDB
* Comes with phpMyAdmin
* Comes preloaded with Underscores, Sage 9 and Bones
* Persistence already configured
* Battery included

I've chosen to go with Sage 9 because it's in active development and as such is
perfect for the kind of things that I've created this repository for.

  $ docker-compose build && docker-compose up
